## 0) Learning outcomes (both tracks)

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Stand up a Zurich instance & plugins** required for App Engine, AI Agents, AI Search, Playbooks, Virtual Agent, and Workspaces. ([ServiceNow][1])
2. **Create a scoped app** two ways (choose‑one): **App Engine Studio** or the **new ServiceNow Studio** experience. ([ServiceNow][2])
3. **Link the app to GitHub** and work with branches/commits from Studio/AES. ([ServiceNow][3])
4. **Model data** by extending **Task** into a new table *Compliance Research Request* with additional fields and status/stage. ([ServiceNow][4])
5. **Publish intake via a Record Producer** in Service Catalog (with category), and understand how this makes intake available in portals and Virtual Agent. ([ServiceNow][5])
6. **Design a Playbook** (staged lifecycle) and surface it in a **Workspace** with lists, filters, and a custom dashboard—triggered on record creation. ([ServiceNow][6])
7. **Build and test an AI Agent** in **AI Agent Studio** that collects intake details via chat and **creates records** (one tool: *save record*). ([ServiceNow][7])
8. **Stand up AI Search**: create a Knowledge Base + 3 articles, configure an **AI Search Profile**, and **extend** search with a **Web Crawler** for external sources. ([ServiceNow][8])
9. **Build a Now Assist Skill Kit “Deep Research” skill** that uses a **Retriever** tied to your AI Search Profile to synthesize an answer and (via deployment to a UI Action) **creates a Knowledge Article** linked back to the originating request and advances the Playbook stage. ([ServiceNow][9])
10. **Enable AI Search in a Service Portal and Virtual Agent** so newly created articles are discoverable (including Q&A/Genius Result cards). ([ServiceNow][10])

> **Governance & safety framing (Instructor note)**
> Remind learners that all AI features must adhere to ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy and enterprise policies; point them to **AI Control Tower** for central oversight of AI assets, guardrails, approvals, and reporting. ([ServiceNow][11])

# INSTRUCTOR GUIDE

### Audience & roles

* Audience: Developers/Platform Engineers, Architects, Product Owners, and selected Business SMEs.
* Roles in instance: **admin** for instructors; students need **app_engine_admin** (or **admin**) plus roles required by Playbooks, AI Search, AI Agents, and Skill Kit (varies by subscription). ([ServiceNow][12])

### Lab structure at a glance

1. **Setup**: instance + plugins + Git (branch created).
2. **Your first app** (choose one path):

   * 2A) App Engine Studio (AES), or
   * 2B) ServiceNow Studio (new Studio)
     Both converge at the same data model, record producer, Playbook, and Workspace.
3. **Your first AI Agent** (AI Agent Studio).
4. **Your first AI Search** (+ external Web Crawler).
5. **Now Assist Skill Kit** deep research skill → UI Action → KB → links back → Playbook stage update.
6. **Portal & Virtual Agent**: enable AI Search and verify.

> **Timing suggestion (full‑day workshop)**
> Setup (45m), App (2.5h), Lunch (45m), AI Agent (75m), AI Search (60m), Skill Kit (60m), Portal/VA & wrap (45m). (Adjust to your cohort experience.)

### Environment prerequisites

* **Zurich** instance (DemoHub if available to your org; otherwise a Developer PDI). DemoHub is partner‑focused; many learners will use PDIs instead. ([ServiceNow][13])
* **Plugins** (ensure entitlements):

  * **App Engine Studio** (AES). ([ServiceNow][14])
  * **ServiceNow Studio** (core app dev—available OOTB). ([ServiceNow][15])
  * **AI Agent Studio / Now Assist AI Agents**. ([ServiceNow][16])
  * **AI Search for Next Experience** (+ **External Content** if using Web Crawler). ([ServiceNow][17])
  * **Playbooks / Process Automation Designer (Workflow Studio)**. ([ServiceNow][6])
  * **Virtual Agent** (plus “Enable generative AI capability in Virtual Agent Designer” if available). ([ServiceNow][18])
  * **Configurable Workspace / UI Builder**. ([ServiceNow][19])
  * (Optional) **Now Assist Skill Kit** (often delivered via Store; ensure Zurich‑compatible version). ([ServiceNow][9])
    Check **List of plugins (Zurich)** for names, store packages, and dependent plugins. ([ServiceNow][20])

### Pre‑flight checks (before learners arrive)

* Validate the instance is on **Zurich** and all plugins above are active. ([ServiceNow][1])
* Create a **sample GitHub org** and an empty repo per team (or let teams create their own). Test **Studio → Link to Source Control** with a PAT/credential. ([ServiceNow][3])
* Prepare a **Service Portal** (e.g., `sp`) and **search profile** stub (empty is fine; students will complete). ([ServiceNow][10])
* Ensure **AI Control Tower** is accessible in case participants ask about governance (show the dashboard). ([ServiceNow][21])

### Assessment & rubrics

* **Bronze**: App created (either path), table & fields ok, record producer works, Playbook stages visible, Workspace loads.
* **Silver**: AI Agent creates records; Git commits at each checkpoint; AI Search profile returns KB results; Web Crawler indexes external site.
* **Gold**: Now Assist Skill Kit skill retrieves from AI Search, creates a KB article via UI Action, links to the task, and advances the Playbook stage; AI Search Q&A/Genius Results active in portal & VA.

### Risk/Safety callouts for regulated enterprises

* Apply **least‑privilege roles**, data separation, and **no PII** in demo content.
* For **AI data flow**, show learners where **data sharing** and **model provider** settings are governed (AI Control Tower & Generative AI Controller). ([ServiceNow][22])

---

# STUDENT GUIDE

> **Important**: When the instructions tell you to **commit to Git**, do it immediately. Keep your **branch** small and **commit message** precise. We’ll provide suggested messages.

---

## Step 1 — Get your instance & install required plugins

1. **Get an instance**

   * If your org uses **DemoHub**, request a Zurich demo instance there (partner‑only in many cases). Otherwise, use a **Developer PDI** from the ServiceNow developer program. (Your instructor will guide you.) ([ServiceNow][13])

2. **Install/verify plugins** (admin):

   * **App Engine Studio** (AES). ([ServiceNow][14])

   * **ServiceNow Studio** (core app dev). ([ServiceNow][15])

   * **AI Agent Studio / Now Assist AI Agents**. ([ServiceNow][7])

   * **AI Search for Next Experience** (+ **External Content** if using Web Crawler). ([ServiceNow][17])

   * **Playbooks / Process Automation Designer (Workflow Studio)**. ([ServiceNow][12])

   * **Virtual Agent** (+ enable generative AI Designer feature). ([ServiceNow][18])

   * **Configurable Workspace / UI Builder**. ([ServiceNow][19])

   > How to discover exact plugin names & dependencies in Zurich: open **List of plugins (Zurich)**. ([ServiceNow][20])

**Checkpoint commit** (create repo first in Step 3):
`docs: add lab prerequisites and plugin checklist (Zurich)`

---

## Step 2 — Choose your build path (do one; both converge later)

### Option 2A — **Build with App Engine Studio (AES)**

1. **Create the app** → *All > App Engine > App Engine Studio* → **Create app**. Name: **AI Compliant Deep Research**; scope suggestion: `x_<yourorg>_deep_research`. ([ServiceNow][2])
2. **Confirm application scope**: your changes should be in your app’s scope (watch the scope badge). Review app scope basics if needed. ([ServiceNow][23])

### Option 2B — **Build with the new ServiceNow Studio**

1. *All > App Engine > ServiceNow Studio* → **Create Application** → **App**. Provide name and description; keep scope consistent (`x_<yourorg>_deep_research`). ([ServiceNow][24])
2. (FYI) Zurich features you’ll notice: smoother Studio navigation and AI‑aware files/flows. ([ServiceNow][25])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(app): scaffold “AI Compliant Deep Research” app (scope x_<org>_deep_research)`

**DJ notes**: You do NOT need to "Publish" your app.

---

## Step 3 — Link your app to **GitHub** (source control) & branching

> You will use **Studio**’s Source Control integration even if you created the app in AES. (AES and Studio share source control patterns in Zurich.) ([ServiceNow][26])

1. Create a new **GitHub repository** (empty; no README/license).
2. In your instance, open your app in **Studio** → **Source Control** → **Link to Source Control**. Provide repo URL (HTTPS or SSH), branch `main`, and credential (PAT or SSH). ([ServiceNow][3])
3. After linking, **Create Branch** for each lab segment:

   * `feature/data-model`
   * `feature/record-producer`
   * `feature/playbook`
   * `feature/workspace`
   * `feature/ai-agent-intake`
   * `feature/ai-search`
   * `feature/skillkit-deep-research` ([ServiceNow][27])

> **Best practice**: Use Git for **application metadata**; use **Update Sets** only for *global* configuration not tied to a scoped app (e.g., portal settings), and for legacy use cases. Know the difference. ([ServiceNow][28])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`chore(git): link app to GitHub; add branch naming convention`

**DJ notes**: Create a new key for this using your local environment (ie terminal on Mac). Use `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` and save it under a new name as to not override your existing key. This will create a public (.pub) and private key. In ServiceNow, search for "Credentials", find SSH Private Key type, add the content of your private key here. On Github side, look for SSH keys section under Settings. Add a new key (content of your public key file) here. Back in ServiceNow, In your Apps "Source Control" section, you can now add the ssh://git@github.... link to your repo and select the SSH credential you created to authenticate.

---

## Step 4 — Update Set & Scope sanity check

1. Ensure your app scope is active before creating tables/objects. ([ServiceNow][23])
2. Create a **Global** Update Set (e.g., `Global_Config_Lab`) for portal/AI Search toggles that live outside your app. (Update Sets capture instance‑level config; your app metadata will remain in Git.) ([ServiceNow][28])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`chore(config): note update set for global changes; verify scope selection`

---

## Step 5 — **Data model**: extend **Task** for “Compliance Research Request”

1. *Studio/AES* → **Create Table** → **Extend table**: choose **Task [task]**. Table label: **Compliance Research Request**; name: `x_<org>_deep_research_request`. ([ServiceNow][4])
2. Add fields (examples; adapt to your org):

   * **Executive sponsor** (Reference → `sys_user`)
   * **Business unit** (Reference → `cmn_department`)
   * **Regulatory driver** (Choice: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI, Other)
   * **Risk level** (Choice: Low/Medium/High)
   * **Due date** (Date/Time)
   * **Summary** (String, 160)
   * **Details** (HTML)
   * **Stage** (Choice: *Intake*, *Research*, *Review*, *Complete*)
   * **Linked knowledge** (Reference → `kb_knowledge`)
3. Save.

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(data): new table extending task + core fields + Stage choices`

---

## Step 6 — **Record Producer** for request intake (Service Catalog)

1. *All > Service Catalog > Catalog Definition > Record Producers* → **New**. Target table: your new table. Title: “**Compliance Research Request**”. Add variables that map to your fields (sponsor, driver, risk, due date, summary, details). ([ServiceNow][5])
2. Place it into a **Catalog** and **Category** (e.g., Catalog “Employee Services”, Category “Compliance”). This organizes the experience in portals and helps discovery. ([ServiceNow][29])
3. (AES path) You can also add a Record Producer from AES’s **Experience** section. ([ServiceNow][30])

> **Why this matters for chat & portals**
> Catalog and Record Producers surface in **Service Portals** and can be discovered via **AI Search** and **Virtual Agent** (VA). VA can call AI Search during a conversation (Run AI Search block) to show KB or relevant items. ([ServiceNow][31])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(intake): record producer + catalog/category for portal/VA discoverability`

**DJ notes**: You need to create an entry using Record Producer and save it first, than you will see an option to add "variables" in that record. Variable are essentially questions. You can do the same using "Catalog Builder". If using Catalog Builder, you can configure it so your Recorder Producer item is available in one of the existing user portals (like Service Portal - ie /sp or Employee Portal - ie /esc). You may need to create a "category" and a "catalog" first. Than configure those values in Catalog Builder. To make this available in /esc portal, set the "Topic" to Employee taxonomy (for example).

**DJ notes2**: When you are creating the "variables" (or Questions) for user input and mapping these to the table fields you created in Step 5, there are tricks you can use so it pulls your existing values. Its easy for fields that are references, but tricky for choice fields. For choice field like "Risk Level", use the question type should be `choice`, sub-type `dropdown (values from table)`, This will add a new tab called `Additional Details`, here you configure where to pull the values from. The table you want is **`sys_choice`** not the table you created in step 5! This table contains ALL the records for ALL the choice fields in your instance so you need to filter it. Select Label as the lookup field, and filter it for table (the one from step 5), Element (name of the risk field in that table).

---

## Step 7 — **Playbook** for staged lifecycle (Intake → Research → Review → Complete)

> In Zurich, Playbooks are authored in **Workflow Studio / Process Automation Designer**. Ensure entitlement is active. ([ServiceNow][6])

1. *All > Workflow Studio (Process Automation Designer)* → **Create Playbook** for your table. Stages:

   * **Intake**: “Validate fields”, “Initial triage”, “Assign handler”.
   * **Research**: “Collect sources”, “SME questions”, “Draft findings”.
   * **Review**: “Peer/legal review”, “Exec sponsor review”.
   * **Complete**: “Publish KB link”, “Close request”.
2. For each stage, add **Activities/Tasks** and (optionally) rules to set the **Stage** field when entering/exiting.
3. Publish.

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(process): playbook with 4 stages + activities for research lifecycle`

([ServiceNow][12])

**DJ notes**: You can review [Intro to playbooks course](https://learning.servicenow.com/lxp/en/pages/learning-course?id=learning_course&course_id=8f848432c3ccc694acc871f9d00131d3) for more details about playbooks. There is no exact setup steps here, you can be creative, make some of the activities interactive with human in the loop, some automated. For example, i set up validate fields using "Wait for condition" activity definition, and under automation it completely the activity is Risk is not empty. You can add validations for all fields. Initial triage I set to "checklist task", this requires a human to physically check the boxes (ie review) that you define. 

---

## Step 8 — **Workspace** to manage these requests

1. Create a **Configurable Workspace** (or use **Workspace Builder** in AES). Add:

   * **Home dashboard** (KPIs: Open by Stage, SLA due soon).
   * **Lists**:

     * “My Team’s Research Requests” (filter by assignment group).
     * “High‑risk Requests” (Risk = High).
     * “Pending Review” (Stage = Review).
   * **Record page**: include the **Playbook** panel and related lists. ([ServiceNow][19])
2. Configure **Playbook to open on record creation** in the record page template (use the Playbook component for your table).
3. Save/Publish.

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(workspace): lists, dashboard, and embedded Playbook on record page`

**DJ notes**: it was tricky to find where to set the playbook in the workspace. I did this in AES Workspace Builder (Your App > User interface section > Add). Configuring lists, is fairly simple, there is a "record pages" button in the middle, and a "record details" on the left, now on the right you should be able to add a playbook in the bottom of the config, your playbook won't show up here, I picked "Globla Playbook Experience", this worked as long as the table you configured for your Playbook, and the table in this setting is the same. You also might see an error on the playbook tab on existing records (when viewing them in the Workspace), but new records you create in the Workspace should have your playbook stages/activities showing correctly.

**DJ notes2**: if you want this workspace to show up in the Workspaces section of your home UI, add a new record in `sys_app_module.list` table, Link Type shold be URL with the /path (not including domain) to your workspace (you can get it from preview).

---

## Step 9 — **AI Agent** handles chat intake & saves the record

1. *All > Now Assist AI Agents > AI Agent Studio* → **New agent**: “**Compliance Intake Agent**”. Define **Role/Persona** and guardrails (ask only necessary questions, avoid PII). ([ServiceNow][7])
2. **Add a Tool** → **Record Operation** (or **Save record**) mapped to your table to create a record with fields gathered during the chat. Keep it as **the single tool**. ([ServiceNow][32])
3. **Test** in **AI Agent Studio testing**: converse until a record is created. Verify the new record shows in your Workspace and **Playbook** starts. ([ServiceNow][33])

> **AI Agent vs Virtual Agent—what’s different?**
> **AI Agents** use agentic patterns to reason, call tools, and complete goals in fewer prescriptive steps; **Virtual Agent** provides guided, stateful conversations and topic‑based flows and can call **AI Search** inside dialogue. Use each where it fits best; both can coexist. ([ServiceNow][34])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(ai-agent): chat intake agent + tool to create compliance request`

---

## Step 10 — **AI Search** foundation

1. **Create a Knowledge Base** (KB) “**Compliance Research**”. ([ServiceNow][8])
2. Create **three Knowledge Articles** (examples):

   * “How to request deep research for a new regulation”
   * “Approved data sources for regulatory research”
   * “KB authoring style guide for compliance research” ([ServiceNow][35])
3. **Create an AI Search Profile** and link sources (your KB; optionally Users, Catalog if useful). Publish the profile. ([ServiceNow][36])

> **Note on Git vs data**
> KB **articles are data** and don’t sync to Git. Your **KB configuration** and search **profile metadata** do. If you must version sample content, store a CSV/markdown in your repo and provide a **Load Data** or **Fix Script** to seed demo articles. ([ServiceNow][26])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(knowledge): KB + search profile published (articles seeded via loader)`

---

## Step 11 — **Extend AI Search** with a **Web Crawler**

1. Activate **External Content for AI Search** if not already. ([ServiceNow][37])
2. Create a **Web Crawler external content connector**: specify allowed domains/paths for a public website (e.g., an industry regulator). Configure crawl settings and a schedule. ([ServiceNow][38])
3. Create a **Search Source** pointing to the connector’s indexed source and link it to your **AI Search Profile**. Re‑publish the profile. ([ServiceNow][39])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(search): external web crawler source + linked to AI Search profile`

---

## Step 12 — **Now Assist Skill Kit**: build the **Deep Research** skill

Goal: A skill that uses **Retriever** to pull from your **AI Search Profile** (KB + crawled content), synthesizes an answer, then creates a **Knowledge Article** and links it to the originating request—exposed via a **UI Action** in your Workspace.

1. *All > Now Assist Skill Kit > Home* → **New skill**: “**Deep Research Synthesis**”. ([ServiceNow][9])
2. **Tool editor** → **Add Retriever**. Point it at your **AI Search Profile**; configure query inputs (e.g., request summary + details). Choose parallel or series if you add multiple tools. ([ServiceNow][40])
3. **Prompt**: In the final prompt, instruct the LLM to produce a **well‑sourced research brief** (bulleted insights + references list), suitable for publication, with a concise abstract.
4. **Test** and iterate until output is acceptable; **Finalize prompt**. ([ServiceNow][41])
5. **Deploy** the skill as a **UI Action** on your table (table: `x_<org>_deep_research_request`). This generates a UI Action you can attach to Workspace. ([YouTube][42])
6. In **Now Assist Admin**, **activate** the published skill (ensure **Display trigger** is enabled). ([ServiceNow][41])
7. **Create a Flow or enhance the UI Action script** to:

   * Create a **kb_knowledge** record (target KB: “Compliance Research”).
   * Set **short_description** = request summary; **text** (HTML) = skill’s output; set **valid_to** if your policy requires review cadence. ([ServiceNow][35])
   * Update the request’s **Linked knowledge** reference to the new article and set **Stage = Review** (or Complete, per your policy) using **Flow Designer: Create/Update Record**. ([ServiceNow][43])

> Skill Kit tools and deployment patterns differ by version; consult the Zurich tool/deployment options overview if needed. ([ServiceNow][44])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(skill): Now Assist “Deep Research” skill + UI Action + flow to create KB & link back`

---

## Step 13 — **Surface AI Search** in Portals and Virtual Agent

1. **Service Portal**: open your portal record (*Service Portal > Portals*), enable **AI Search**, and assign your **Search Application/Profile**. Test queries; you should see your articles and, if enabled, **Q&A/Genius Result** cards. ([ServiceNow][10])
2. **Virtual Agent**: in the Conversational Interfaces admin console, **Activate AI Search** so topics can call it (Run AI Search block). Test by asking a question that matches your new KB. ([ServiceNow][45])
3. (Optional) Enable **Now Assist in AI Search** so users get Q&A **Genius Results** summaries pulled from your KB. ([ServiceNow][46])

**Checkpoint commit**:
`feat(portal-va): enable AI Search in portal & VA; verify results and Q&A cards`

---

# Wrap‑up: What you built

* A compliant **intake‑to‑insight** flow: Portal/VA intake → Task record → Playbook‑guided research → **AI Agent** chat intake path → **AI Search** across KB + external site → **Now Assist Skill Kit** synthesis → auto‑**KB creation** → **link back** → **stage progression** in Playbook.
* Everything version‑controlled (app metadata), with **Update Sets** only for global toggles. ([ServiceNow][26])
* Search and assistance now visible to users in **Workspace**, **Portal**, and **Virtual Agent**. ([ServiceNow][19])

---

## Troubleshooting & tips

* **Plugin missing / access denied**: Verify entitlement and that the plugin is available in **Zurich** (check plugin catalog). ([ServiceNow][20])
* **Studio ↔ Git link fails**: Use HTTPS with a PAT for simplicity; confirm credentials record and branch exist. ([ServiceNow][3])
* **Articles not appearing in search**: Ensure the **Search Profile** includes your KB source; re‑publish profile; check indexing status. ([ServiceNow][36])
* **Web Crawler yields nothing**: Confirm allowed roots/paths and schedule, then run an on‑demand crawl. ([ServiceNow][38])
* **Virtual Agent can’t find content**: Ensure **AI Search** is activated for VA and your profile is assigned. ([ServiceNow][45])
* **Q&A/Genius Results missing**: Verify Now Assist in AI Search is enabled and a Genius Results config is linked and active for your profile. ([ServiceNow][46])
* **Playbook doesn’t show**: Confirm the table is enabled for Playbooks and the component is present in the record page; check stage mapping. ([ServiceNow][6])
* **Skill Kit output not saved**: Use a **UI Action** deployment and either script the record creation or invoke a **Flow** action on completion. ([YouTube][42])

### What to tell executives who will use this app

“Your deep‑research request is **triaged and governed**: intake through a compliant form or chat; staged execution under a **Playbook**; answers are **synthesized** using curated internal KB + approved web sources; results are published as a **Knowledge Article** with traceability back to your task; and all AI usage is **governed centrally**.”
